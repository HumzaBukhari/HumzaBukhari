# Hi there, I'm Humza
I'm a CS student at UIC who is (hopefully) going to graduate in Winter 2025. I'm passionate about complex problem-solving and adapting my skills to crack issues; I treat programming almost like solving a puzzle. I'm always excited to learn and apply new skills, languages, and environments. I'm currently learning about programming microcontrollers and connecting them together over wifi and Bluetooth. In the future, I aspire to be a backend or network developer, but I am open to a lot of different positions. In an unstable job market, it helps to be a jack of all trades.

## Fun Facts
-I used to be the captain of the robots team back in high school. I worked closely with the teachers running the club and organized my own leadership team to keep the club flowing smoothly. I also helped teach the incoming kids how the system we used worked, brainstorming ideas for robots, and how our competitions functioned. It was a fun experience to contribute to a group I had been a part of for so many years.

-I have TAed at UIC before for our Langauge and Automata class, which talks about computer theory, starting with finite and regular languages and building up to Turing Machines. I got to work alongside my professor and other graduate TAs and learn from their teaching process. I also worked with my fellow TAs on the best way to teach labs. It was interesting to learn something one semester and then try to teach it the next semester; It gave me a new perspective on what I learned in school.
